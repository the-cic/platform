# Synopsis

## The beginning

Protagonist `P` is a science nerd with few skills in the outside world, who gets frequently bullied and is buying a gun for protection. He goes to the firing range and shoots a bit. This is like minimal tutorial to fire, crouch, jump etc.

As P is returning from the range, he stumbles upon characters `A` and `C`.  C is about to execute A. P takes out his gun and tells C to let A go. P is hysterical with the gun and accidentally fires, C fires back at P and P fires again and kills him. 

A thanks P for the help, takes C's gun and disappears into thin air. P realises that he is now in trouble as it now looks like he's killed C for no apparent reason and the police are on their way. C is actually still alive, but dying and tells P that A escaped using a time travel device. C also has a similar device but inferior to A's as it can only be used to travel some 5 seconds through time. However, C's device can measure the destination time and place to which A's device has travelled. Before dying, C tells P that A has travelled to tomorrow and that P should catch A and use his device to travel to before the shooting and stop it. 

P takes C's device and flees the scene as the police arrive, to hide until tomorrow. 

By tomorrow, P has examined the device and discovered that in time he will be able to improve it and has now learned how to operate it. The device can be set to travel to a limited amount of time back in time after which the device needs to recharge for a period.

P waits for A, but there is still a policeman guarding the scene. As A appears, P tries to stop him and draws his gun which causes the policeman to start firing at them and P has to kill him. 

A has escaped using his device, and P flees to find him again, now a wanted fugitive.

## The adventure

P follows A to catch him and take his device, so that eventually he can go back to stop himself killing C. On the way he uses the device to solve various situations. While he can solve some situations with stealth, he also gets in situations where he has to kill more and more people, but rationalises that once he goes back all this will never have happened.

As P collects experience, he can use it to upgrade the device, to lengthen the available time travel, send enemies to the future, etc. Or he can choose to improve his physical abilities.

In the end, A realises why P is following him and to prevent him from going back and risk getting A killed by C, A sabotages his device. However, P is able to combine what is left of A's device with his to create a fixed synchronised time portal, through which he can go back to the beginning, and then come back, but has to leave the device as part of the portal and can't take it with him.

## The end

P returns to the past, goes to the gun shop and offends the owner with yo mama's ass so big I need elephant slugs jokes. P from the past is yelled at at the shop and is discouraged from buying a gun and so never encounters A and C. 

P now has an option:

### The feel-bad ending

P returns to the present. C kills A and P is left feeling bad for allowing that and never finding out what it was all about.

### Or...

P goes to face C and A, now wiser to the fact that something strange is going on and more in control of his actions as in the beginning. C explains that A is actually Adolph Hitler, but Adolph seizes the opportunity of C getting distracted by P to take C's gun and kills C.

### The bad ending

P fails to kill Hitler who escapes to tomorrow again. P is left in the same position as in the beginning. The police are on their way. This is fail.

Actually this is iffy. 

### The less good ending

P kills Hitler. The police are on their way, so he returns to the present. Now all the other killings didn't happen, but he remains haunted by not being able to save C. But at least Hitler is dead. 

### The good ending

Instead of going back to the present, P takes Adolph's time device, which is fully powered, and travels back to before A killed C and kills A as he takes the gun from C. 

Realising he now must do the same, the previous P takes the device from A and goes back. By doing that the previous P becomes the current P and device on A becomes the device held by the current P, which he now gives to C. 

C thanks P and takes Hitler's body and uses Hitler's device to return Hitler to 1945, while P returns to the present. 

## The epilogue

Killing Hitler, either by P or C, did not change the course history but prevented it from changing. Hitler had used the device to escape the bunker in Berlin, and C was the grandson of the man who had developed the device and had made his device from his grandfather's notes. C returned the dead Hitler's body to the bunker, where the allies had found him.

In the scenario when both C and Hitler died, and C didn't take Hitler's body back to 1945, the allies had found Hitler's double in the bunker.
